THE PROCESS OF MAKING 'YOUR VIRTUAL DIARY'

I originally started with a datatbase in a separate deployed repository, but decided to create a database in the same repository as the front end. From there, I fleshed out the pages, and continued with session authorization. I had a couple hiccups with the session authorization, but persevered and conquered. From there, I continued to add bootstrap elements and an aesthetic overall for the website. Once I got the MVP for the project, I continued to add a carousel outsourced from bootstrap to make sure I was able to learn something more challenging in regards to implenting a third party resource. The project was a valuable experience, and I'm grateful that  I continued to work on challenges, though I had the minimum requirements. Overall, I created not one but three databases, and though one wasn't necessarily used, I look forward to using that singular database to translate my project from EJS into a REACT Frontend.
